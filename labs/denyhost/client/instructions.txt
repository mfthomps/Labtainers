Title: Deny Hosts Lab Exercise

1. Background

This Labtainer exercise explores the use of the 
denyhosts utility on an SSH server to
limit SSH login attempts from an IP address.

2. Performing the lab
The lab is started from the Labtainer working 
directory on your Linux host, e.g., a Linux VM.
From there, issue the command:

    start.py denyhost

The resulting virtual terminals include a display of
these instructions, a terminal connected to a client,
and a terminal connected to a SSH server.

To navigate this instruction, the arrow keys along with 
with the Space/Home/End/Page-Up/Page-Down keys are usable.
To exit navigation of this instruction, type 'q'.

3. Tasks
Brute force attacks on SSH servers may attempt thousands of different 
user IDs and passwords, often using automated tools, or "bots".  
The denyhosts utility allows an administrator
to deny access from IP addresses that are the sources of multiple
failed login attempts.

3.1. Review configuration files
     We will consider three key files associated with the denyhosts 
     utility.  

     auth.log
     ========
     The first is the /var/log/auth.log file, which reflects
     the success of login attempts.  What that file using:
         sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log

     and then ssh to 172.20.0.3 as user "hank" with password "hank21".

     Note: when connecting the first time, enter 'yes' when
     prompted 'Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?'

     Observe the event in the /var/log/auth.log

     Then, exit and again ssh to 172.20.0.3, but this time use an
     incorrect password.  Notice the failed login attempt event in
     the /var/log/auth.log

     The denyhosts utility observes events in the auth.log to detect
     failed login attempts.

     denyhosts.config
     ================
     Review the content of /etc/denyhosts.config:
         sudo less /etc/denyhosts.config
     Note in particular the description and values for 
     DENY_THRESHOLD_INVALID and DENY_THRESHOLD_VALID

     hosts.deny
     ==========
     This system file is used by the networking functions to block
     connections from selected IP addresses.  An entry in this file
     will block the connection prior to it reaching the intended service.
     Thus, the SSH daemon will never see connection attempts from these
     sources, thereby helping to avoid consuming system resource.
     The denyhosts utility adds entries to this file when the quantity
     of failed login attempts recorded in the /var/log/auth.log exceeds
     the thresholds defined in /etc/denyhosts.config.

3.2. Lock out a valid user using the bot
     The bot.py program in the client home directory is a crude bot
     that attempts a brute force ssh login by iterating through simple
     passwords based on the user ID.  For example, if given a user ID
     of "hank", it will try: hank1, hank2, hank3... as the password.     
     Before you start the bot, go to the server and tail the 
     /var/log/auth.log file.  
     On the client, make note of your IP address:
         ifconfig

     Then start the bot, giving a user of "hank"
         ./bot.py hank

     Based on your review of the /etc/denyhosts.config file, at what
     point do you expect the client IP to be added to the hosts.deny
     file?

     Did the connection get denied at the point you expected?  If not
     consider the implications of the DAEMON_SLEEP value in the 
     denyhosts.config file.
     
3.3 Restore login ability of the valid user
     View the /etc/hosts.deny file, and note the entry for your
     IP address.  That will prevent anyone from that IP from connecting
     to the SSH server.

     What if the login failures were an honest mistake?  
     Simply deleting the entry in /etc/hosts.deny file is generally 
     not sufficient because deny hosts keeps other databases. 

     One option is to "whitelist" the client computer by adding an 
     entry to the /etc/hosts.allow file, e.g.,

         ALL: 172.20.0.2

     Add that entry and confirm you are now able to ssh from the client.
     Use vim or nano to add the entry, e.g.,
    
         sudo nano /etc/hosts.allow 

3.5 Lock out an invalid user

     First, change the IP address of the client so that our client is 
     no longer in the hosts.allow whitelist.  On the client:

         ifconfig eth0 172.20.0.9

     Then try the bot.py again, but this time provide a different user,
     e.g., 
   
         ./bot.py tony

     Did the connection get rejected after a similar number of attempts
     as when you ran the bot with the "hank" user?  Why?
     Consider why you may want a different threshold for attempts with
     valid user names as opposed to invalid user names.

4. Stop the Labtainer

When the lab is completed, or you'd like to stop working for a while, run

    stop.py denyhost

from the host Labtainer working directory.  You can always restart the
Labtainer to continue your work.  When the Labtainer is stopped, a
zip file is created and copied to a location displayed by the stop.py
command.  When the lab is completed, send that zip file to the instructor.
